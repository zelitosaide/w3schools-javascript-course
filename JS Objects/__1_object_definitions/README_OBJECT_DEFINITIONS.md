# JavaScript Objects

In JavaScript, objects are king. If you understand objects, you understand JavaScript.

In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

* Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
* Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
* Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
* Dates are always objects
* Maths are always objects
* Regular expressions are always objects
* Arrays are always objects
* Functions are always objects
* Objects are always objects

All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.

## JavaScript Primitives

A **primitive value** is a value that has no properties or methods.

**3.14** is a primitive value.

A **primitive data type** is data that has a primitive value.

JavaScript defines 7 types of primitive data types:

### Examples

* string
* number
* boolean
* null
* undefined
* symbol
* bigint

## Immutable

Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and cannot be changed).

if x = 3.14, you can change the value of x, but you cannot change the value of 3.14.

| value | Type | Comment |
|-------|------|---------|
|"Hello"|string|"Hello" is always "Hello"|
|  3.14 |number|3.14 is always 3.14|
