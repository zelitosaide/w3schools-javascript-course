### JavaScript Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

    Operator 	  Example 	    Same As
    = 	        x = y 	      x = y
    += 	        x += y 	      x = x + y
    -= 	        x -= y 	      x = x - y
    *= 	        x *= y 	      x = x * y
    /= 	        x /= y 	      x = x / y
    %= 	        x %= y 	      x = x % y
    <<= 	      x <<= y 	    x = x << y
    >>= 	      x >>= y 	    x = x >> y
    >>>= 	      x >>>= y 	    x = x >>> y
    &= 	        x &= y 	      x = x & y
    ^= 	        x ^= y 	      x = x ^ y
    |= 	        x |= y 	      x = x | y
    **= 	      x **= y 	    x = x ** y

The **= operator is a part of ECMAScript 2016 (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_2016.asp).


__Assignment Examples__

The _=_ assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.

    let x = 10; 

The _+=_ assignment operator adds a value to a variable.

    let x = 10;
    x += 5; 

The _-=_ assignment operator subtracts a value from a variable.

    let x = 10;
    x -= 5; 

The _*=_ assignment operator multiplies a variable.

    let x = 10;
    x *= 5; 

The _/=_ assignment divides a variable.

    let x = 10;
    x /= 5; 

The _%=_ assignment operator assigns a remainder to a variable.

    let x = 10;
    x %= 5;
