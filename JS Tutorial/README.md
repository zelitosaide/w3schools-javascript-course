### Intro

__JavaScript Can Change **HTML Content**__

One of many JavaScript HTML methods is getElementById().

The example below "finds" an HTML element (with id="demo"), and changes the **element content (innerHTML)** to "Hello JavaScript":

JavaScript accepts **both double and single quotes:**

__JavaScript Can Change HTML Attribute Values__

__JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS)__

Changing the style of an HTML element, is a **variant of changing an HTML attribute:**

__JavaScript Can Hide HTML Elements__

Hiding HTML elements can be done by changing the display style:

__JavaScript Can Show HTML Elements__

Showing hidden HTML elements can also be done by changing the display style:


### Where to

__The **script** Tag__

In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between **script** and **script** tags.

Old JavaScript examples may use a **type** attribute: __<script type="text/javascript">__.
The type attribute is not required. JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML.


__JavaScript Functions and Events__

A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.

For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.

You will learn much more about functions and events in later chapters.



__JavaScript in <head> or <body>__

You can place **any number of scripts** in an HTML document.

Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.


__JavaScript in <head>__

In this example, a JavaScript function is placed in the <head> section of an HTML page.

The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked:


__JavaScript in <body>__

In this example, a JavaScript function is placed in the <body> section of an HTML page.

The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked:

Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed, because **script interpretation slows down the display**.


__External JavaScript__

Scripts can also be placed in external files:

External scripts are practical when the same code is used **in many different web pages**.

JavaScript files have the file extension .js.

To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag:


You can place an external script reference in <head> or <body> as you like.

The script **will behave as if it was located exactly where** the <script> tag is located.

External scripts cannot contain <script> tags.



__External JavaScript Advantages__

Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:

    It separates HTML and code
    It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
    Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads


To add several script files to one page  - use several script tags:

    <script src="myScript1.js"></script>
    <script src="myScript2.js"></script> 



__External References__

An external script can be referenced in 3 different ways

    with a full URL (a full web address)
    with a file path (like /js/)
    without any path


This example uses a **full URL** to link to myScript.js:

     <script src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript.js"></script>

This example uses a file path to link to myScript.js:

     <script src="/js/myScript.js"></script> 

This example uses no path to link to myScript.js

     <script src="myScript.js"></script>
