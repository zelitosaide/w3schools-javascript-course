# JavaScript Style Guide

Always use the same coding conventions for all your JavaScript projects.

## JavaScript coding Conventions

Coding conventions are **style guidelines for programming**. They typically cover:

* Naming and declaration rules for variables and functions.
* Rules for the use of white space, indentation, and comments.
* Programming practices and principles.

Coding conventions **secure quality**:

* Improve code readability
* Make code maintenance easier

Coding conventions can be documented rules for teams to follow, or just be your individual coding practice.

> This page describes the general JavaScript code conventions used by W3Schools.

> You should also read the next chapter "Best Practices", and learn how to avoid coding pitfalls.

## Variable Names

At W3Schools we use **camelCase** for identifier names (variables and functions).

All names starts with a **latter**.

At the bottom of this page, you will find a wider discussion about naming rules.

```javascript
firstName = "John";
lastName = "Doe";

price = 19.90;
tax = 0.20;

fullPrice = price + (price * tax);
```
