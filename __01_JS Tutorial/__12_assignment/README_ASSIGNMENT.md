# JavaScript Assignment

## JavaScript Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

| Operator | Example | Same As    |
| -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| `=`      | x = y   | x = y      |
| `+=`     | x += y  | x = x + y  |
| `-=`     | x -= y  | x = x - y  |
| `*=`     | x *= y  | x = x * y  |
| `/=`     | x /= y  | x = x / y  |
| `%=`     | x %= y  | x = x % y  |
| `**=`    | x **= y | x = x ** y |

> The `**=` operator is a part of [ECMAScript 2016](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_2016.asp)
> It does not work in Internet Explorer 11 or earlier.

## Shift Assignment Operators

| Operator | Example  | Same As     |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `<<=`    | x <<= y  | x = x << y  |
| `>>=`    | x >>= y  | x = x >>= y |
| `>>>=`   | x >>>= y | x = x >>> y |

## Bitwise Assignment Operators

| Operator | Example | Same As    |
| -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| `&=`     | x &= y  | x = x & y  |
| `^=`     | x ^= y  | x = x ^ y  |
| `\|=`    | x \|= y | x = x \| y |

## The = Operator

The `=` assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.

```javascript
let x = 10;
```

## The += Operator

The `+=` assignment operator adds a value to a variable.

```javascript
let x = 10;
x += 5;
```

## The -= Operator

The `-=` assignment operator subtracts a value from a variable.

```javascript
let x = 10;
x -= 5;
```

## The *= Operator

The `*=` assignment operator multiplies a variable.

```javascript
let x = 10;
x *= 5;
```

## The /= Operator

The `/=` assignment operator divides a variable.

```javascript
let x = 10;
x /= 5;
```

## The %= Operator

The `%=` assignment operator assigns a remainder to a variable.

```javascript
let x = 10;
x %= 5;
```

## The <<= Operator

The `<<=` assignment operator left shifts a variable.

```javascript
let x = -100;
x <<= 5;
```

## The >>= Operator

The `>>=` assignment operator right shifts a variable (signed).

```javascript
let x = -100;
x >>= 5;
```

## The >>>= Operator

The `>>>=` assignment operator right shifts a variable (unsigned).

```javascript
let x = -100;
x >>>= 5;
```

## The &= Operator

The `&=` assignment operator ANDs a variable.

```javascript
let x = 10;
x &= 5;
```

## The |= Operator

The `|=` assignment operator ORs a variable.

```javascript
let x = 10;
x |= 5;
```
