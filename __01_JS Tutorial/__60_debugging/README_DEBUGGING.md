## Code Debugging

Programming code might contain syntax errors, or logical errors.

Many of these errors are difficult to diagnose.

Often, when programming code contains errors, nothing will happen. There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors.

Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called debugging.
